.Sh NAME
.Nm rset
.Nd remote staging and execution tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rset
.Op Fl entv
.Op Fl F Ar sshconfig_file
.Op Fl f Ar routes_file
.Op Fl l Ar option_name
.Op Fl x Ar label_pattern
.Ar hostname ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
evaluates script fragments written in Progressive Label Notation
.Pq Xr pln 5 ,
executing each script in sequence using ssh connection multiplexing.
.Nm
accepts one or more hostnames which match the labels in
.Ar routes_file .
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl e
Stop executing if an error is encountered within a label.
.It Fl n
Do not connect to remote hosts.
Special text defined between { and } is still executed locally.
Hostnames are highlighted to show what characters the
.Ar hostname
matched.
.It Fl t
Allow TTY input by copying the content of each label to the remote host instead
of opening a pipe to the interpreter.
.It Fl v
Print the HTTP log messages after each label is executed.
.It Fl F
Specify a
.Pa config
file for
.Xr ssh 1
to use.
.It Fl f
Specify a
.Ar routes_file .
This file is composed of labels which correspond to
hostnames or IP addresses which are matched against
.Ar hostname .
The default is
.Pa routes.pln .
.It Fl l
List the specified option state associated with each label.
Only valid with
.Fl n .
See
.Sx OPTIONS
for the set of supported arguments.
.It Fl x
Execute labels matching the specified regex.
By default only labels beginning with [0-9a-z] are evaluated.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
Status messages for each stage of execution may be customized by setting
.Ev RSET_HOST_CONNECT ,
.Ev RSET_LABEL_EXEC_BEGIN ,
.Ev RSET_LABEL_EXEC_END ,
.Ev RSET_LABEL_EXEC_ERROR ,
and
.Ev RSET_HOST_DISCONNECT .
.Pp
Setting
.Ev RSET_HOST_CONNECT
disables the default status messages and is the only required variable.
These have no effect in conjunction with the
.Fl n
flag.
The following variables are interpolated:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width 4n
.It \%%e
exit code
.It \%%l
label name
.It \%%h
hostname
.It \%%T
rfc-3339 timestamp
.It \%%%
literal
.Ql %
.El
.Pp
Execution on the remote host sets the following environment variables:
.Bl -tag -width "RSET_ENVIRON"
.It Ev INSTALL_URL
Used by
.Xr rinstall 1
for fetching content from
.Pa _sources .
.It Ev SD
Staging directory where
.Nm
unpacks utilities and configuration files.
.El
.Pp
Environment state may set for the duration of the ssh session
using
.Xr renv 1
using
.Ql name="value"
as the first argument.
.Sh FILES
Available hosts and the pathnames to labeled scripts to run are read from
.Pa routes.pln ,
located in the current directory.
.Pp
A ssh master is established at the beginning of a session and all subsequent
interactions with a host are run over a socket at
.Pa /tmp/rset_control_{hostname} .
.Pp
The local directory
.Pa _rutils
is created if it does not exist, and is shipped to the remote host at the
beginning of each execution to directory named
.Pa /tmp/rset_staging_{http_port} .
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are recognized when parsing a
.Xr pln 5
file:
.Ss \&environment=
Space separated list of environment variables.
Only values matching the pattern
.Ql name="value"
are added to the environment on the remote host.
.Ss \&environment_file=
Path to a file which defines environment variables validated by
.Xr renv 1 .
.Ss \&interpreter=
The interpreter to run a script fragment with.
Defaults to
.Pa /bin/sh ,
but any language may be used that is capable of reading scripts over STDIN.
.Ss \&local_interpreter=
The interpreter to evaluate content that is prepended to a script
Defaults to
.Pa /bin/sh .
.Ss \&execute_with=
Command for elevating privileges, such as
.Xr doas 1
and
.Xr sudo 8 .
