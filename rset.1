.Sh NAME
.Nm rset
.Nd configure systems using labeled scripts
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rset
.Op Fl ln
.Op Fl F Ar sshconfig_file
.Op Fl f Ar route_file
.Ar host_pattern
.Op Ar label_pattern
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
evaluates script fragments written in Progressive Label Notation
.Pq Xr pln 5 ,
executing each one in tern using ssh connection multiplexing.
.Nm
requires one parameter specifying the regular expression matching hosts
to configure.
.Pp
A second regex may be specified to limit execution to labels matching a
specific pattern.
By default only labels beginning with [0-9a-z] are evaluated.
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl l
List the options associated with each label.
.It Fl n
Do not execute commands.
Hostnames are highlighted to show what characters the
.Ar host_pattern
matched.
.It Fl F
Specify a
.Pa config
file for
.Xr ssh 1
to use.
.It Fl f
Specify a
.Ar route_file .
This file is composed of labels which correspond to
hostnames or IP addresses which are matched against
.Ar host_pattern .
The default is
.Pa routes.pln .
.It Fl t
Allow TTY input by copying the content of each label to the remote host instead
of opening a pipe to the interpreter.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
Execution on the remote host sets the following environment variables:
.Ev INSTALL_URL ,
.Ev LABEL ,
.Ev ROUTE_LABEL .
.Sh FILES
Available hosts and the pathnames to labeled scripts to run are read from
.Pa routes.pln ,
located in the current directory.
.Pp
A ssh master is established at the beginning of a session and all subsequent
interactions with a host are run over a socket at
.Pa /tmp/rset_control_{hostname} .
.Pp
The local directory
.Pa _rutils
must exist, and is shipped to the remote host at the beginning of each
execution as a temporary directory named
.Pa /tmp/rset_staging_{http_port} .
This is used to set the current working directory in the environment of the
remote host, hence the capabilities of
.Nm
may easily be extend by accessing utilities at this location.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Pa Most options are not set in the command line, but are modified using
key-value pairs.
.Ss \&interpreter=
The interpreter to run a script fragment with.
Defaults to
.Pa /bin/sh ,
but any language may be used that is capable of reading scripts over STDIN.
.Ss \&execute_using=
Command for elevating privileges, such as
.Xr doas 1
and
.Xr sudo 8 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rinstall 1 ,
.Xr rsub 1 ,
.Xr ssh_config 5 ,
.Xr re_format 7
