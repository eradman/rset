.Sh NAME
.Nm rinstall
.Nd fetch and install scripts from local dirs or http sources
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rinstall
.Op Fl o Ar owner:group
.Op Fl m Ar mode
.Op Fl x
.Ar source
.Ar target
.Nm rinstall
.Op Fl o Ar owner:group

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is shipped to remote machines by
.Xr rset 1
to provide a standard method of installing files made available over HTTP, or
from the current working directory for files already staged.
.Pp
The
.Ar target
must be absolute path, and is created if it does not exist.
If the
.Ar target
exists but is not the same as
.Ar source , and the
.Fl x
flag is not activated,
.Xr diff 1
is called to display the difference before the
.Ar target
is updated.
.Pp
If the
.Ar target
is omitted, the
.Ar source
is placed in the staging directory defined by the
.Ev SD
environment variable.
.Pp
.Nm
always checks for a
local copy of the
.Ar source
before attempting to fetch a file from the location defined by the environment
variable
.Ev INSTALL_URL .
.Pp
.Nm
is inspired by
.Xr install 1
found on Linux and *BSD systems.
Under the hood
.Nm
calls
.Xr chmod 1
and
.Xr chown 8 .
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl m
Mode to set when the file is updated.
This argument is passed to
.Xr chmod 1 .
.It Fl o
Owner and/or group to set.
This argument is passed to
.Xr chown 8 .
.It Fl x
Do not call
.Xr diff 1
to display the differences.
