.Sh DESCRIPTION
Progressive Label Notation
is a configuration format used by
.Xr rset 1 ,
and is designed to be evaluated sequentially.
.Nm
supports options defined by
.Em key=value
pairs and text fragments designated by tab indentation
.Bd -literal -offset indent
interpreter=/bin/sh -x

packages:
	pkg_add ruby%3.2
	ln -sf /usr/local/bin/ruby32 /usr/local/bin/ruby

	    && rcctl restart smtpd

# vim:ts=4:syntax=sh
.Ed
.Pp
A label may also be followed by special content between a pair of braces on the
beginning of a line. A common use for this is to set environment variables using
local configuration
.Bd -literal -offset indent
www:
{
	cat ssl.env
}
	echo $SSL_PASSWORD > /etc/keys/global.pass
.Ed
.Sh OPTIONS
Each option may be set multiple times, and is effective for labels that follow.
Reset an option to the implementation-defined default using
.Ql \&=
without a value.
.Sh LABELS
Label names do not need to be unique and may contain any series of
characters except for single and double quotes.
A series of pathnames for use by the application may be specified after the
.Ql \&:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
svc1.local: etc/ rc.d/
	httpd.pln
.Ed
.Pp
Labels may be split into multiple aliases separated by using commas
.Bd -literal -offset indent
svc1.local,10.0.0.10:
	common.pln
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, sequence expressions may be used to match a range of hosts
.Bd -literal -offset indent
db{1..4}.local:
	autofailover.pln
.Ed
.Sh COMMENTS
Comments begin with a hash
.Pq Ql \&#
character, and can only be used the beginning of a line.
